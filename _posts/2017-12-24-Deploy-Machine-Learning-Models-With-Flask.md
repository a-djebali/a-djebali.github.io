title: Deploy Machine Learning Models with Flask
---

Well most of us know how to:

* Write machine learning models
* Train them 
* Test them as well 

**But how do we deploy them to production?** Well in this [Github](https://goo.gl/H5cfu6) repo I explained how to deploy machine learning models to production using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) (a micro web framework written in Python), in addition how to serve them as a RESTful API (web services).

For this I just built a simple random forest model around iris dataset [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)][[2](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html)] in order to walk you through the main stuff ...

Welcome if you get issues!
